Type "aren't you" into a search engine and you'll get a handful of search suggestions, ranging from "aren't you clever?" to "aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?". If you've ever done a web search, you've probably seen an autocompletion â€” a handy list of words that pops up under your search, guessing at what you were about to type.

Search engines aren't the only place you'll find this mechanism. Cell phones use autocomplete/autocorrect to predict/correct words that are entered for, for example, text messages. Some IDEs (integrated development environments - used for coding / software development) use autocomplete to make the process of coding more efficient by offering suggestions for completing long function or variable names.

In this lab, we are going to implement our own version of an autocomplete/autocorrect engine using a tree structure called a trie, as described in this document.
